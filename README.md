                                                    LiRNASEQ_evergrande

Description
--------------------
The LiRNASEQ_evergrande is used to analyze single cell RNA Seq experiments, generated by the Evergrande Center for Immunologic Diseases  

    Usage:
        Run.py [-h] [-p P] [-t T] [-time Time] [-bc BC] [-u U] [-c C]
        
    Arguments:
        -h
            produces - 
            -p P        path of the genomes
            -t T        transcriptome
            -time Time  amount of time to run the experiment
            -bc BC	Barcode length(plus the UMI length)
            -u U        UMI Length
            -c C        The path of the directory including this directory
        -p 
            directory path of the genome
        -t
            transcriptome
        -time Time
            How long processing will take?
        -bc BC
            Barcode length including the umi length
        -u
            UMI length
        -c
            Current Path of the code directory
    Example
        RUN.py -p C:\..\S9 -t 1 -time 36 -bc 12 -u 3 -c C:\..\LiRNASEQ_evergrande\liRNAseq_newdpzpipeline
